Noodling around with programming language.

I'm going to dump any language experiments here.

- graphck: attempt to understand TLA+ by writing my own
- strand.rs: minimal strand implementation
- bidir_typeck.rs: implementation of https://arxiv.org/abs/1306.6032 "Complete and Easy Bidirectional Typechecking for Higher-Rank Polymorphism"
- ctl_star.rs: model checker for CTL* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CTL*
